# Note-Taker

## Description 

For this challenge assignment I was tasked with creating a functional note taking web application. When I open the note web application I am presented with a landing page. When I click the "Get Started" button I am presented with a page that has two columns (one for previously saved notes and one for a note that is actively being created). When I complete the note title and text fields I am presented with a button to save the note. Then the note appears on the left hand column below the previously created notes. I can also delete a note by clicking the trash can icon on a note that has been previously created.
